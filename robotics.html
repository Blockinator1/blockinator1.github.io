                    <p>The FIRST Robotics Competition seeks to combine the excitement of a competitive sport with the rigors of science and technology. Teams must design, build, test, and operate robots to achieve goals specific to each season of the FIRST Robotics Competition. It is designed to replicate the experience of real-world engineering, with individual FIRST Robotics Teams somewhat replicating the environment one could expect in a tech startup, so that students can learn how teams
                    of real engineers work together to solve a problem under constraints, both engineering and budgetary, and practice their technical and social skills.</p>

                    <p>I had heard of the FIRST Robotics Team at AMES before I had even gone to my first day of classes, and knew it would probably be of interest to me. Three years later, I can say that I am glad I chose to join it. I am on the programming subteam of our Robotics Team, and have greatly enjoyed the chance to write code for a real-world project.</p>

                    <p>From my three years participating in FRC, I've noticed that most games involve a goal involving manipulating a game piece, and a goal involving manipulating the robot itself. This year's game follows that pattern; CRESCENDO, this year's competition, involves shooting "notes" (squishy rings) into a "speaker" and "amp", as well as getting the robot onto the "stage" at the end of the match. </p>
